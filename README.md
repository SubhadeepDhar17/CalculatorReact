<h2>Simple calculator with React JS</h2>

<h5>I still have to make changes in the CSS section because right now it looks super boring.</h5>
<br>
Moving on, This project is refrence to the Basic React Calculator form Meta's Front End Projects from the course "Basic React".<br>
You can find the main code in App.Js in the 'src' folder.

<h5> I hope you find it useful </h5>
